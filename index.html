    <h1>Nathaniel Rogers - Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my RMIT-intro2IT-A1 intro page!</p> 
    <p>A little about me to start. I'm Nathaniel, student ID s3829502, (email: s3829502@student.rmit.edu.au) 25 living in Queensland, away from home and the dream to be a big grown up living in my own house was a brilliant scam, because life is so much harder as an adult. Apparently there is such thing as too much cake! (I digress) I was born and raised in Australia, moving between Queensland and New South Wales until I took two years to volunteer as a missionary for my church in Scotland and Ireland which now holds a dear place in my heart.</p>
    <p>My Dad worked for an internationally known IT company my whole childhood so I cant really remember a time when we weren't using technology, but because it was what my dad did I didn't think it would be cool to also go into that field so I tried art instead in high school. Long story short, I was failing art so I changed to IT and everything just made sense so I succumbed and realised my future would be in IT.</p>

    <span style="font-style:italic; font-size: 10pt">I remember spending way too much time playing this pinball game because someone was using the phone so we couldn't ALSO be on the internet. Good ol' dial up.</span>
    <p>I have been working for an e-commerce agency (www.neocreative.com) for three years doing module development primarily in PHP.</p>
